### Experience

__Summer 2020 - Present, Summer 2019__

__University of Washington, Seattle WA__ - _Student Research Assistant/Python Programmer, Funded by the National Science Foundation via a Research Experience for Undergraduates grant_

__Summer 2020 - Present__

*	Implement action policies for Reinforcement Learning Linear Quadratic Systems and extend their application to a multiplayer environment.
*	Update policy gradient algorithm to multiplayer environment using OpenAI’s existing Vanilla Policy Gradient and PyTorch.
*	Co-author in: “Liyuan Zheng, Tanner Fiez, Zane Alumbaugh, Benjamin Chasnov and Lillian Ratliff (2020), Stackelberg Actor-Critic: A Game-Theoretic Perspective,” and “Stackelberg Actor-Critic: Game-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.”

#### July 2020

__BuddhiBox__ - _Freelance Software Engineer_

*	Created a bot that scrubs daily emails from “Help a Reporter” (HARO) and picks out links containing relevant key words and phrases. The bot then notifies the user via email with only the relevant links. Implemented using Python, Beautiful Soup, and Google’s official Gmail API.

#### Summer 2019
__University of Washington, Seattle WA__ - _Student Research Assistant/Python Programmer, Funded by the National Science Foundation via a Research Experience for Undergraduates grant_

* Implemented gradient-based learning algorithms for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the PyTorch framework; the algorithms are based on a novel hierarchical game theoretic formulation that leads to implicitly defined learning dynamics using second order information on the discriminator loss function.
* Implemented an optimizer class for PyTorch that used second-order derivatives to predict future optimizations and allowed for the learning agent to act on these predictions.
* Built the foundations for a novel approach to accelerate the GAN learning process by leveraging the eigenstructure of the Jacobian of the learning dynamics.

#### July 2015 - June 2017, February 2019

__Bay Area Geophysical Society (BAGS), Berkeley CA__ - _Webmaster, Website Creator_

* Created current website from scratch (February 2019) - Employer requested a simple static implementation. Used HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
* Kept pages up to date and maintained health of the website (July 2015 - June 2017)

### Coursework
