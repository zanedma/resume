### Skills

Python, C/C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Scala, Prolog, Haskell, Unix, Git

### Education

#### September 2017 - Present

__University of California Santa Cruz - Santa Cruz CA__

* Computer Science B.S. - Expected Winter 2021

#### September 2013 - June 2017

__Berkeley High School - Berkeley CA__

* High School Diploma

### Experience

#### Summer 2020 - Present, Summer 2019

__University of Washington, Seattle WA__ - _Student Research Assistant/Python Programmer, Funded by the National Science Foundation via a Research Experience for Undergraduates grant_

__Summer 2020 - Present__

* Implemented action policies for Reinforcement Learning Linear Quadratic Systems, and extend their application to a multiplayer environment
* Update gradient-based policy gradient algorithm to multiplayer environment using OpenAI's Vanilla Policy Gradient and PyTorch

__Summer 2019__

* Implemented gradient-based learning algorithms for training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using the PyTorch framework; the algorithms are based on a novel hierarchical game theoretic formulation that leads to implicitly defined learning dynamics using second order information on the discriminator loss function
* Implemented an optimizer class for PyTorch that used second-order derivatives to predict future optimizations and allowed for the learning agent to act on these predictions
* Built the foundations for a novel approach to accelerate the GAN learning process by leveraging the eigenstructure of the Jacobian of the learning dynamics

#### July 2015 - June 2017, February 2019

__Bay Area Geophysical Society (BAGS), Berkeley CA__ - _Webmaster, Website Creator_

* Created current website from scratch (February 2019) - Employer requested a simple static implementation. Used HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript
* Kept pages up to date and maintained health of the website (July 2015 - June 2017)
